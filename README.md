# Smartphone Simulation App

## 📄 Description
This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles in Java through a simple smartphone simulation. It highlights:
1. Inheritance: The `Smartphone` class inherits from the base `Phone` class.
2. Interfaces: Implements `Camera` and `Clock` interfaces for additional functionality.
3. Polymorphism: Demonstrates how different methods are implemented and called dynamically.

### Functionality
1. **Attributes:**
   - `brand` and `model`: Represent the basic properties of a phone.
2. **Methods:**
   - `call(String number)`: Simulates calling a phone number.
   - `photograph()`: Simulates taking a photo (from the `Camera` interface).
   - `alarm()`: Simulates an alarm ringing (from the `Clock` interface).
